## Versioning

This package follows conventional Go versioning. Any version up to version 1.0.0 is considered "unstable" and the API may change.

We put a lot of thought into the design of this library and don't expect there to be many breaking changes. You are free to use this library in a production setting. However, keep an eye on the release notes as it will be rapidly changing.
